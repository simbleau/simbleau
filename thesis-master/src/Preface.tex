This research aims to survey modern 2D vector graphic rendering contention and provide an analysis thereof. The subject matter is themed around modern rendering techniques and detailing the architecture and design of a benchmarking framework, \textit{\toollinkedname}, engineered to provide the tooling for CPU and GPU-centric benchmarking. Parts of this work serve to provide code snippets, data artifacts, and theories supported by \textit{\toollinkedname}. This research assumes an intermediate understanding of computer graphics and graduate knowledge of computer science.
