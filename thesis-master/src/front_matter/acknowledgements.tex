I would like to thank Dr. Raph Levien and Dr. Mitch Parry, whose expertise have sharpened my thinking and brought my work to a higher level. Their involvement has helped guide this research and contribute to a larger community.

I would also like to thank Appalachian State University, for sponsoring my research with infrastructure and funding. Without their help, many of these results would not be possible.
